# Transcompp

Transcompp is a tool that allows users to quantify phenotypic plasticity starting from single-cell or bulk measurements of phenotype. Transcompp uses Markov modeling and optimization to estimate best-fit values for stochastic transition rates, transition rate intervals, and phenotype-specific proliferation parameters.

## Input Data

Input data to Transcompp is either in the form of single-cell measurements of phenotype-related attributes, or in the form of summary statistics from bulk data indicating the relative abundance of each phenotypic state in the population. More details about the types and formatting requirements for input data can be found in the *Sample Data* folder

## Installation

Run the *Transcompp.exe* file to install. The program first installs the MATLAB Runtime environment (Free) that is required to execute MATLAB-based software.  For more details about the runtime environment please click [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html).
